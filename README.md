# PD Travel Co

PD Travel Co is a simple HTML page with CSS stying and minimal Javascript functionality. This was my first project
Practicing CSS. The logo and images were sourced from the internet and used to mimic the look/feel of a commercial
travel agency page. 

I decided to make this into a fully designed page in order to show off my styling capabilties on 
my Github/portfolio. The nav does not link anywhere. It was kept as a single page project to practice stlying.
